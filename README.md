# Docker 

Docker is a platform used to develop, ship, and run applications inside lightweight, portable containers. Containers package an application and all its dependencies into a single unit that can run consistently across any environment, whether it’s a developer's laptop, a test server, or production systems. Docker simplifies the deployment and scaling of applications by allowing developers to write once and run anywhere, avoiding issues related to system differences.

Here’s a breakdown of the key concepts and components of Docker:

## 1. Containers
A container is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, such as the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system.  
Docker containers use **containerization** to ensure that applications run the same in different environments, solving the "it works on my machine" problem.  
Containers are often compared to virtual machines (VMs), but they are much more lightweight because they share the host OS's kernel, rather than running a full operating system.

## 2. Images
A Docker image is a read-only template used to create containers. Images include the application code, runtime, libraries, and any dependencies required to run the application.  
Images are stored in repositories (often hosted on Docker Hub or private registries).  
Images are built using a **Dockerfile**, a text document that defines the steps to create the image. This includes the base operating system, dependencies, and any configurations needed for the application.

## 3. Dockerfile
A **Dockerfile** is a script containing a series of instructions for building a Docker image. It defines what the image will contain and how it will be configured.  
Example of a simple Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.8-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["python", "app.py"].
